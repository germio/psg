// things i dont like msTerminal
// - cursor does not change color if match background, so it disapears
// - focus on (lxterm?) chnage from filled block to empty block depends if have focus, my brain has been trained for that and want to see it.
// mouse does not scroll in vi
// middle click does not paste
// ssh-agent env need to be setup in each new window manually, no easy way to make it inherit (till ssh-agent actually run on windows?)
// things i like:
// fonts are nicer than lxterm
// copy can copy format, but paste add "windows terminal", so annoying!
// better than std ubuntu bash since that was a lousy dos box.
// mac is better than windoze in these regards
